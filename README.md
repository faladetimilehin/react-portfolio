## Overview

In this project, I used React to develop the initial scaffolding for my portfolio site. It's designed to provide a polished and professional look, following the principles of mobile-first design. The portfolio aims to set me apart from other developers by using React and other modern technologies.

## Design

"Good" design is subjective, but I've strived to make the portfolio look polished and professional. Here are some design guidelines I followed:

- Mobile-first design for a responsive layout.
- Carefully selected color palette for a unique look.
- Readable font size and color choices to ensure a pleasant viewing experience.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router (for navigation)

## Portfolio Contents

My portfolio includes the following information:

- **Your Name**
- Links to your:
  - GitHub Profile

## Components

The portfolio is built with several components, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Header**: Rendered across the entire site, containing a Navbar.
- **Project Gallery**: Dynamically renders 6 instances of the Project component using project data stored in a JSON file.
